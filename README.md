## About

This is a website for informal travel recommendations, tips, photos and information we thought would be useful for friends and prospective travelers. We are leisure travelers and this is a compilation of our favourite spots.

Our information is split into places and each has its own page with a list of sub-places we recommend or comment on. We chose these divisions somewhat arbitrarily, but in general sub-places represent self-contained sites within the main place.

While we try to maintain information relevant and up to date, please note some information could be outdated.

All images are our own work unless indicated otherwise.
