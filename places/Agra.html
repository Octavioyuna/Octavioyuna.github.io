      <h3>Taj Mahal</h3>
      <p>The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his favourite wife. It was completed in 1643.</p>
      <p>Be aware there are very large crowds here, mostly national visitors. I would recommend arranging a guide beforehand. Also be aware that freelance photographers might approach you. I would recommend asking for the price if you are interested in their service. Personally, I thought it was nice.</p>
