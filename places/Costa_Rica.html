<h2>Costa Rica</h2>
  <div class="boxes_span">
      <div class="box">
      <p>Costa Rica is a biologically megadiverse country. The varieties of species of all major clades is fascinating. Combined with the natural beauty (beaches etc.) and the culture makes this really a superb place.</p>
      <p>Most people speak English in hotels and agencies so language barriers are not serious.</p>

<h3>Manuel Antonio</h3>
  <div class="boxes_span">
    <div class="box">
      
      <p>This is quite a large park and you could actually spend up to 2-3 days here, but we did 2 days. We would recommend to get a guide since they will know about the animals and usually have a portable telescope with them to observe them. We arranged one beforehand, but you can also ask for one at the entrance.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
      <h4>Animals</h4>
      <p>Here you'll find 3 of the 4 monkey species of CR. They are all very fascinating. Capuchin monkeys are quite friendly and you do not need to be scared of them. Howling monkeys are more timid. You are also very likely to find sloths (2 spp.). Personally I really liked the coatis. They are fox-like mammals that are very indifferent to human presence and walk around the park. We saw an entire family with babies. There are also lots of birds, insects and reptiles the guide can show you.</p>

<h3>Sloth sanctuary</h3>
  <div class="boxes_span">
    <div class="box">
      
      <p>This is a place for sloths that need veterinary assistance (sloths are protected by CR law). It was very fun. You can see the sloths up close and the tour is interesting.</p>

<h3>Corcovado</h3>
  <div class="boxes_span">
    <div class="box">
      <p>Corcovado is a large tropical rainforest on the Pacific coast. If you have enough time, it is definitely with coming here. However, it is geographically difficult to access. We got there by boat starting from Sierpe and then we went to Drake Bay. We stayed at the Sirena, which is a station in the forest. They have basic amenities there but it is expensive to buy food there, so would recommend taking a few things. Meals are organised in the canteen.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <h4>Animals</h4>
      <p>Here you can find all 4 species of monkeys. There are also some aquatic reptiles. We luckily saw a tapir plus an anteater.</p>

            <h4>Drake Bay - places to eat</h4>
      <p>Before taking the boat ride we ate at Claudio's Grill. They had excellent food.</p>
