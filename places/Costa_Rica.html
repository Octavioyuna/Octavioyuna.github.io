      <h3>Manuel Antonio</h3>
      <p>This is quite a large park and you could actually spend up to 2-3 days here, but we did 2 days. We would recommend to get a guide since they will know about the animals and take a binocular with them to observe the animals. We arranged one beforehand, but you can also ask for one at the entrance.</p>
      <h4>Animals</h4>
      <p>Here you'll find 3 of the 4 monkey species of CR. They are all very fascinating. Capuchin monkeys are quite friendly and you do not need to be scared of them. Howling monkeys are more timid. You are also very very likely to find sloths (2 spp.). Personally I really liked the coatis. They are fox-like mammals that are very, very indifferent to human presence. They walk around the park. We saw an entire family with babies. There are also lots of birds, insects and reptiles the guide can show you.</p>

      <h3>Sloth sanctuary</h3>
      <p>This is a place for sloths that need veterinary assistance (sloths are protected by CR law). It was very fun. You can see the sloths up close and the tour is interesting.</p>

      <h3>Corcovado</h3>
      <p>This is also on the Pacific coast. If you have enough time, it is definitely with coming here. However, it is geographically difficult to access. We got there by boat.</p>
      <h4>Animals</h4>
      <p>Here you can find all 4 species of monkeys. Also aquatic reptiles. We luckily saw a tapir.</p>
