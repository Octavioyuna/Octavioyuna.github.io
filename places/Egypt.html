      <h4>Giza pyramid complex</h4>
      <p>Giza hosts the famous pyramids, the last remaining intact "Seven Wonders of the Ancient World". The two largest pyramids are the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu (aka the Great Pyramid, constructed c.â€‰2580) and the Pyramid of Khafre. A series of smaller pyramids, known as the "Queen's Pyramids" are next to these. The Great Sphinx is also close to them.</p>
      <p>It is possible to go inside the pyramids - be aware the passage is very narrow. It is also possible to go for a camel ride next to the pyramids.</p>
      <p>Be aware that there are large crowds of tourists here as well as people who might want to sell you things and bargain with you.</p>
