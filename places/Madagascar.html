<h2>Madagascar</h2>
  <div class="boxes_span">
      <div class="box">
      <p>Madagascar has some of the most amazing animals in the world. Because of its geographical isolation, many endemic species are found nowhere else on earth. This includes the ~100 species of lemur. It also has fabulous reptiles and arthropods.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of poverty but there are lots of chances to help the economy if you travel there.</p>

<h3>Lemurs</h3>
  <div class="boxes_span">
  <div class="box">
      
      <p>Lemurs are primates endemic to the country of Madagascar. There are more than 100 different species of lemur: black and white ruffed lemur, common brown lemur, bamboo lemur, crowned lemur, red bellied lemur, aye aye and mouse lemur, sifaka, indri indri... Some lemurs are exclusively nocturnal (like aye aye or mouse lemur which is the smallest lemur); for example the aye aye only comes out at night. This lemur species has very long and thin middle fingers which are designed for eating coconuts and tapping trees to listen for grubs (see photo). The Indri indri lemur is known for its loud screams, which they use to mark their teritory. In this lemur family, females are the pack leaders: they decide when and where the pack should move in search for the food, and they get the access to the food first. Ring-tailed lemurs are one of the cutest and most curious lemurs, that live in the western coast of madagascar, in arid dessert-like areas. The best places to see lemurs are national parks in Madagascar, for example in Andasibe (Malazamotra – primary forest, Matandia national parks – secondary forest), Akanin Ny Nofy, where there are many species that wonder freely and are not afraid of people at all. If you bring bananas with you (their favorite food), they will come to you, and climb all over you, sometimes even jump on top of your head!</p>

<h3>Natural history of lemurs</h3>
<div class="boxes_span">
<div class="box">
      
      <p>Lemurs are thought to have arrived to Madagascar via natural vegetation rafts (such as tree debris) as descendants of primates from the African continent [1]. Lemurs are wet nose primates (strepsirrhines), which includes lemurs, aye-ayes, lorises, and galagos. A simplified evolutionary tree is shown below.</p>

<h3>Andasibe-Mantadia National Park</h3>
  <div class="boxes_span">
    <div class="box">
      
      <p>Here you can spot some wild lemurs. There is a primary forest and a secondary forest with non-endemic flora. They are sometimes high up in the trees and sometimes they jump around in the lower levels of the forest.</p>
    </div>
    
  <div class="box">
            <h4>Indri</h4>
      <p>This is the largest lemur species in the world. They are distinguished by episodes of large characteristic cries.</p>

<h3>Lemur island and Vakona Forest Lodge</h3>
  <div class="boxes_span">
  <div class="box">
      
      <p>To see the lemurs really up close, this is an excellent place. There are a series of artificial islands, each with different species of lemur. The lemurs live is a semi-wild setting.</p>
