      <h2>Madagascar</h2>
      <p>Madagascar has some of the most amazing animals in the world. Because of its geographical isolation, many endemic species are found nowhere else on earth. This includes the ~100 species of lemur. It also has fabulous reptiles and arthropods.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of poverty but there are lots of chances to help the economy if you travel there.</p>

      <h3>Lemurs</h3>
      <p>Lemurs are primates endemic to the country of Madagascar. There are more than 100 different species of lemur: black and white ruffed lemur, common brown lemur, bamboo lemur, crowned lemur, red bellied lemur, aye aye and mouse lemur, sifaka, indri indri... Some lemurs are exclusively nocturnal (like aye aye or mouse lemur which is the smallest lemur); for example the aye aye only comes out at night. This lemur species has very long and thin middle fingers which are designed for eating coconuts and tapping trees to listen for grubs (see photo). The Indri indri lemur is known for its loud screams, which they use to mark their teritory. In this lemur family, females are the pack leaders: they decide when and where the pack should move in search for the food, and they get the access to the food first. Ring-tailed lemurs are one of the cutest and most curious lemurs, that live in the western coast of madagascar, in arid dessert-like areas. The best places to see lemurs are national parks in Madagascar, for example in Andasibe (Malazamotra – primary forest, Matandia national parks – secondary forest), Akanin Ny Nofy, where there are many species that wonder freely and are not afraid of people at all. If you bring bananas with you (their favorite food), they will come to you, and climb all over you, sometimes even jump on top of your head!</p>

      <h3>Natural history of lemurs</h3>
      <p>Lemurs are thought to have arrived to Madagascar via vegetation rafts as descendants of primates from the continent.</p>

      <p>This is a really beautiful place. It is a peninsula with wild lemurs which visit regularly and many activities are organised by the facility. These include day tours, night tours, and visits to the nearby fishing village, which has traditional art/industry.</p>
            <h4>Indri</h4>
      <p>This is the largest lemur species in the world. They are distinguished by episodes of large characteristic cries.</p>
