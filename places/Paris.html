  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world and one of the major cities in Europe. It is extremely rich in culture and impressive architecture. Most of the mainstream tourism is localised to certain hotspots which are justifiably busy. However they are worth visiting in spite of the crowds. Furthermore, you can still get a very nice feel of the city by going to less touristy places.</p>
