      <h2>Quito</h2>
      <p>You can spend several days here as there is a lot to see. My favourite things were La Mitad del Mundo and the art museums. There is significnat poverty in the inner city unfortunately.</p>

      <h3>La Mitad del Mundo</h3>
      <p>La Mitad del Mundo has the physical and geographical qeuator. There is a series of monuments and mueseums that I highly recommend. There are 2 sites. One with the monument and museums, and another with the physical equator where they perform physical experiments which prove you are indeed at the exact equator. These are fascinating and I hesitate to spoil it with detail. Here there is also an anthropological/ethnographic museum where you can do a guided  tour. I  found it  extremely  interesting  and  enjoyable.</p>

      <h3>La Capilla del Hombre</h3>
      <p>If you are more into art, I would very highly recommend La Capilla del Hombre which has an enormous collection of paintings by  Oswaldo Guayasamín. Oswaldo Guayasamín's house is right next to it with a collection of art from many painters.</p>
