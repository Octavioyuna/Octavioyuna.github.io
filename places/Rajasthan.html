      <h2>Rajasthan</h2>
      <p>Rajasthan is a federal state of India bordering Pakistan. It has a unique history and culture due to heritage from the Mughal Empire and other cultures.</p>
      <p>The Hindu temples  are  among the most beautiful attractions here, although  In general, I would recommend to carry around some little plastic shoe covers to visit the Hindu temples, as sometimes shoes are prohibited but socks or bare feet with plastic covers are allowed.</p>

      <h3>City Palace, Udaipur</h3>
      <p>The large palace complex on the bank of Lake Pichola was first built in the 1500s by the Maharanas (Kings). It is possible to obtain a guide at the entrance who will explain the history of the palace and the artwork.</p>
      <p>Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Park right next to the palace is very beautiful and has resident monkeys. The grey monkeys here are relatively pacific, as opposed to the more ref-faced maaque moneys There is also the possibility of a lake ride to Jag Mandir, a small palace on the lake.</p>

      <h3>Mount Abu  and Dilwara Temples</h3>
      <p>The Dilwara temples contain some of the most  impression  stonework  that  I have ever seen.  The temples   are  very meticulously  carved  with geometric patterns and jain deities. There is a hiking path that goes to a hill offering a viewpoint of the mountains and a funny rock formation called the toad rock.</p>
