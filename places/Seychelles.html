      <h2>Seychelles</h2>
      <p>Seychelles is a small archipelago nation. It has absolutely amazing beaches and is great for hiking and snorkeling. There are three main permanently settled islands with services: Mahe, Praslin and La Digue.</p>
      <p>Services and tourism are quite well developed on the main islands and it is quite easy to travel between them. There are several companies that do island transfers and they can be booked online quite easily.</p>
      <p>In general, I found the best beaches were in La Digue and Praslin, whereas Mahe is great for hiking.</p>
      <p>Curiously, driving is on the left although the most established international language is French.</p>

      <h3>Mahe</h3>
      <p>Mahe is the largest of the islands and contains Victoria, the capital town. It also contains the airport. It is convenient to get a car to get around because the beaches and hiking trails are dispersed around the island.</p>
      <h4>Hiking</h4>
      <p>There are several hiking trails around the island. Some of them have a beautiful viewpoint at the end. Some of the trail is quite steep.</p>

      <h3>Praslin</h3>
      <p>Here I would recommend a trip to Curieuse Island where there is a free-roaming giant turtle population and a nice ~1/2 hour hike that crosses the island. St. Pierre is a small island that is very beautiful.</p>

      <h3>La Digue</h3>
      <p>Here there is the famous Anse Source d'Argent. The island is small enough to be explored with a bike.</p>
